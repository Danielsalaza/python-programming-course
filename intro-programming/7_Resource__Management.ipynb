        "A software development process must carefully consider the resources required to run a program. Usually, at the very first stages of development, the use of resources, the performance, the throughput of a software are not always critical. These are non-functional requirements that are, many times, taken into account when the program is already providing the desired functionalities and it is closed to be transferred to an operational environment (dealing with real workloads). \n",
        "\n",
        "Physical resources are a cornerstone to ensure that the functionality is properly delivered. Flexibility, scalability and other non-functional aspects are not always tested but they are critical when our software must evolve.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many factors that can potentially impact the use of resources in our software: the architecture, the users, the operational environment, etc. Most of them must be, theoretically, stated in the non-functional requirements, designed using the proper notation in UML (e.g. physical deployment diagram) and implemented through the proper technologies (e.g. gateways, protocols, etc.) and programming models (e.g. push, event-oriented, etc.). Although non-functional requirements are very relevant to the success of a software program, the implementation of such requirements is sometimes not prioritized, delegating them to a secondary position. However, the history has demonstrated that these non-functional aspects of a system are, at least, as important as the functionalities. If a capability is delivered but it cannot be properly used, what are we creating?\n",
        "\n",
        "As examples of how systems have evolved overtime considering non-functional aspects, we can list some interesting well-known social network plataforms such as Twitter, Linkedin or Whatsapp. They basically applied the principle: \"**Think big, start small and keep growing**\". The functionality was almost the same but, the sucess of their platforms implied a great effort on the non-functional aspects driving them to a success. For more details, in the software architecture evolution, you can take a look to the following links:\n",

        "\n",
        "However, in this chapter, we focus more on the low-level aspects of resource management. Those that can be managed at the programming level. Any software platform (a process) will consume physical resources: processing units, memory, input/output devices (e.g. network). In this context, programming, as an engineering technique, must consider the proper use of these three categories of resources. Good programming techniques will help us to make a proper use of computer resources. Then, other engineering methods such as software design and software architecture methods will also address the problem from other high-level perspectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "The experience has demonstrated that bad coding practices or small issues in a program can lead us to further and unexpected huge problems in a larger setting. We all have experienced these situations:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Too much time to run some program because the CPU is completely busy running another process. (Processor).\n",
        "* Lack of memory because a program is allocating more and more memory while it is running. (Memory)\n",
        "* Fail to save a file because it is being used by another program, although the program is not anymore running. (Input/Output system)\n",
        "\n",
        "These situations lead us to think in the origin of such issues. In general, if we assume that the program does not have any special requirement (e.g. CPU, memory or input/output), then, there is a potential problem in the implementation, at the coding level: a memory leak, a zombie process, a file that has not been closed, a bad use of the programming language, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "That is why, in this chapter, the focus relies on understanding the resources a program can use, identifying potential points of interest and implementing Python programs more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do so, the chapter is divided into two main subsections:\n",
        "* Process management.\n",
        "* Memory management.\n",
        "* Input/Output system. This last topic will be also presented in the next chapter."

The source code is loaded in the main memory, there is a stack to pass parameters to a function and to leave the result, a heap to create new objects, etc. At the same time, the code is executed consuming CPU cycles, new processes and threads can be created to parallelize the processing and the input/output system is used to gather inputs from an user or an external service and to persist results.
