As an example, we can classify algorithms in a category as follows:\n","\n","* **Recursive algorithms**: trying to solve a base case and, then, make a recursion to solve the general case. E.g. Factorial.\n","* **Dynamic programmign algorithms**: remembering past results (when there is an overlapping) and using them to find new resuls. E.g. Fibonacci numbers.\n","* **Backtracking algorithms**: trying to find a solution applying a depth-first recursive search until finding a solution. E.g. The famous $n$ queens.\n","* **Divide and conquer algorithms**: dividing the problem into smaller problems that can be then solved recursively to finally combine solutions and deliver a general solution. E.g. Binary search.\n","* **Greedy algorithms**: finding not just a solution but the best one. E.g. Count money using the fewest bills and coins.\n","* **Branch and bound algorithms**: calculating the probability of getting a solution for optimization problems. E.g. The famous TSP (Travelling salesman problem) problem.\n","* **Brute force algorithms**: testing all posible solutions until a satisfactory solution is found. It makes use of heuristics and optimization techniques. E.g. Break a password.\n","* **Randomized algorithms**: getting a solution by running a randomized number of times to make a decission. E.g. Quicksort and pivot selction.\n","\n","The keypoint is how the algorithm tackle the solution of a problem and how the algorithm makes use of basic functionalities like searching and/or sorting to prepare the data and generate (intermediary and final) solutions. \n","\n","That is why, it is necessary to know and govern basic algorithms for searching and sorting data under different data structures to be able to define and design more complex algorithms. In general, the design of algorithms makes use of different types of algorithms. In other words, more complex algorithms are built on top of other more basic algorithms. \n","\n","For instance, an advanced artificial intelligence technique makes use of another type of algorithm (e.g. branch and bound) that, at the same time, makes use of other techniques such as searching and sorting. So, an algorithm relies on other layers of algorithms.\n","\n","In this chapter, some basic searching  (find an element in a collection) and sorting (ordering a collection of values) algorithms are presented.
