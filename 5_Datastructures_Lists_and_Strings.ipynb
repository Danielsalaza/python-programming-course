        "In the first chapter of this course, we saw that programming languages can be classified depending on the type of programming paradigm (e.g. functional, object-oriented, etc.). The Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm in which we represent the data and operations of our problem and solution making an exercise of abstraction by defining classes including attributes and operations (methods). Complex datatypes and user-defined datatypes are usually defined using objects. This means we define a class with the required attributes and operations to manage the entities of our domain. Following, the main definitions for the OOP paradigm are presented:\n",

        "In our context, we only need to know these basic definitions since our data structures in Python will be implemented through classes (like the class list) and, by extension, we need to know how to invoke a method, how to access an attribute, etc.\n",
